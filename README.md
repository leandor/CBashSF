# CBashSF
READ-ONLY fork from Waruddar's SVN repo at SF: https://sourceforge.net/projects/cbash/

The idea was to pull into GitHub the initial code that only existed in SVN before.

This repository holds the initial development history for CBash.dll bundled on [wrye-bash/Wrye-Bash](https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash), 
and holds the existing sources for the stable 0.6.0 version last released (from [this commit](https://github.com/leandor/CBashSF/commit/98e6e13860ad0f95c1c62f0414517c787846e313)).

Original [Ethathron/CBash](https://github.com/Ethatron/CBash) repository was created from the final state of this sources, but no previous 
history was imported and some folders were lost on the initial import.

The current development repository for CBash is located here -> [wrye-bash/CBash](https://github.com/wrye-bash/CBash)
